projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      Over the years I created some projects for myself. Their code quality is not the best because the main objective was to make them work with as little effort as possible. But I think these can be still
      good conversation starters and show my interests.
    assignments:

      - title: Home automation project
        tagline: >
          This project uses python to add features to Shelly smart bulbs and switches. For example, turn down when I leave home (It is detected by not being able to reach my phone on Wi-Fi).

      - title: Music player
        tagline: >
          This project uses python and youtube-dl to make an ad-free, easy to use web interface that can be both used in browser and feed videos to kodi media application.

    
      - title: WebRTC recorder and player
        tagline: >
          This project uses WebRTC technology to record audio from a phone, and play it back when it detects silence. The goal was to make some kind of diary that helps organize your thoughts as well. Later it
          was connected with a STT module, too (Silero STT). Technology used: javascript and python.

      - title: Slideshow generator
        tagline: "I created an application in C++ with OpenCV that creates music videos from images where the fade effect uses pattern matching."

      - title: Panoramic image generator
        tagline: "I used the pre-existing panoramic image generation applications and made them a little better by trying to detect the clusters of images that make one big panoramic image and run panoramic image generation with multiple different parameters."

      - title: Cat-dog morph
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqhTSnTUnng"
        tagline: >
          I wanted to create a convincing cat to dog morph, but all my very original attempts failed, so I used this pre-trained model. Technology used: python, tensorflow.

      - title: Phone number sudoku
        link: "https://bakaiadamphonenumber.herokuapp.com/"
        tagline: >
          I wanted to create some kind of puzzle for recruiters to get my phone number. The sudoku is generated from a pre-set seed. Technology used: javascript.

      - title: Ball bouncing demo
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMITldk3DE"
        tagline: "I created sphere collision calculations  in C++ and rendered it in POVRay."
