projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      Over the years I created some projects for myself. Their code quality is not the best because the main objective was to make them work with as little effort as possible. But I think these can be still
      good conversation starters and show my interests.
    assignments:

      - title: Home autmation project
        tagline: >
          This project uses python to add features to Shelly smart bulbs and switches. For example turn down when I leave home (It is detected by not being able to reach my phone on WIFI).

      - title: Music player
        tagline: >
          This project uses python and youtube-dl to make an ad-free easy to use web interface that can be both used in browser and feed videos to kodi media application.

    
      - title: WebRTC recorder and player
        tagline: >
          This project uses WebRTC technology to record audio from phone, and play it back when it detects silence. The goal was to make some kind of diary that helps organize your thoughts as well. Later it
          was connected with a STT module,too(Silero STT). Technology used: javascript and python.

      - title: Slideshow generator
        tagline: "I created an application in C++ with OpenCV that creates music videos from images where the fade effect uses pattern matching."

      - title: Panoramic image generator
        tagline: "I used the pre-exisiting panoramic image generation applications and made them a little better by trying to detect the clusters of images that make one big panoramic image and run panoramic image generation with multiple different parameters."

      - title: Cat-dog morph
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqhTSnTUnng"
        tagline: >
          I wantted to create convincing cat to dog morph, but all my very original attempts failed, so I used this pre-trained model. Technology used: python, tensorflow.

      - title: Phone number sudoku
        link: "https://bakaiadamphonenumber.herokuapp.com/"
        tagline: >
          I wantted to create some kind of puzzle for recruiters to get my phone number. The sudoku is generated from a pre-set seed. Tehcnology used: javascript.

      - title: Ball bouncing demo
